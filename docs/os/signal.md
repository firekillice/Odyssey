# 信号
## signal
* A signal is a small message that notifies a process that an event of some type has occurred in the system. 
* Low-level hard- ware exceptions are processed by the kernel’s exception handlers and would not normally be visible to user processes. 
* Each signal type corresponds to some kind of system event.
* Signals provide a mechanism for exposing the occurrence of such exceptions to user processes. 
* Signals are a mechanism for **one-way asynchronous notifications**.
